    <Cell>These dark pauldrons belong to a unique set. The antipode of knight-errant, a black knight masks their identity and that of their liege by not displaying heraldry or by wearing false colours, using this anonymity to conduct various misdeeds from high road robbery to murder. Once commissioned by such a robber knight, this suit of armor is coated in sleek matte black to better fade into the night. There is no way to tell for sure how many blood stains have been hidden under these layers of paint over the years. Rich golden trim creates an illusion of respectability to fool merchants, travelers and bailiffs.  Needless to say, anyone wearing such an attire in public would attract attention.</Cell>
